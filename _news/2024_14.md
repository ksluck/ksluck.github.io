Bringing more Robotics to the VU Amsterdam! Starting now in the new academic year we will have for the first time a foundational Robotics course in the CS/AI curriculum for Bachelor students. Lot's of work, but we have assembled a great team with Kim Baraka as co-teacher and Mark Adamik as the lead for the practicals.
