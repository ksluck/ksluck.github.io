I presented our work on self-imitation learning for co-design at the [European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning 2024](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/ewrl17-2024/) in Toulouse, France: [Following Ancestral Footsteps: Co-Designing Morphology and Behaviour with Self-Imitation Learning](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=P0kRLiTx04). This work was together with my Master student Sergio Hernández-Gutiérrez and Prof. Ville Kyrki from Aalto University.
