I will be giving an invited talk about our research on co-adapting robot morphology and behaviour with reinforcement learning at the [EARL workshop](https://earl.robot-learning.net/). 
Are you also working on Co-Adaptation/Co-Design of robots or evolutionary robots? Consider submitting a workshop paper and let's chat at R:SS 2024 in Delft, The Netherlands!
