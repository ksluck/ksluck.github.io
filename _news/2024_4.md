I am a recipient of the [NWO AIned XS grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/national-growth-fund/ained/ained-xs-europe) provided by the [Dutch Research Council](https://www.nwo.nl/en) and the [AIned Foundation](https://ained.nl/en/). In this projct we will be developing new methods using Large Language Models for policy generation for real-world robotics.
