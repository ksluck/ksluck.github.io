We organized a workshop on [Morphology-Aware Policy and Design Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/corl-mapodel-workshop/home) at the Conference on Robot Learning. If you are interested in cross-embodiment learning, embodiment-aware learning or Co-Design of robot behaviour and design, then check out our live stream. Also congratulations to all accepted workshop authors!
