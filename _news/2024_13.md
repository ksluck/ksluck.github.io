I presented our work on [Accelerating Laboratory Automation Through Robot Skill Learning For Sample Scraping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14875) at [IEEE CASE 2024](https://2024.ieeecase.org/) in Bari, Italy. This was a collaboration with an amazing team at the University of Liverpool, shout-out to my awesome collegue [Gabriella Pizzuto](https://gabriellapizzuto.github.io/) for putting this work together!
The paper was also nominated for the [Best Healthcare Application award](https://2024.ieeecase.org/awards/) at CASE 2024!
